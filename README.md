# Golang-Basics

This repository is a collection of exercises and examples that reflect the concepts and topics I am learning in the Go programming language (Golang).

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate my progress and understanding of various programming concepts in Go. It serves as a learning resource and a showcase of my practical implementations.

## Directory Structure

The directory structure of this repository follows a specific format. Each main topic or concept in Go has its own directory within the root section. For example, topics like string formatting, printing, and loops will have separate directories.

Inside each topic directory, you will find Go source code files related to that particular topic. The naming convention for these files is as follows:
- If it's a demonstration file, the name will be `demo_<related-name>.go`.
- If it's an exercise or practice file, the name will be `p<serial-number>_<related-name>.go`.
